## City overview

> An overview of the host city: why is it suitable for useR!, how easy is it to get to?

### City Suitability

NYC occupies a central position within the Northeast Megalopolis, containing over 50 million people. That gives a large local audience to attend the conference. The city has three universities, NYU, Columbia, and CUNY, between them having over 360 thousand students. Additionally, the city has an strong presence in data science-related industries, particularly finance and healthcare.

### Travelling to NYC

NYC has three airports close by, two of which are international: John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. The city's position on the East coast allows for relatively easy attendance from Europe and Africa.

It is on a major Amtrak train route, and has many long-distance bus services, allowing for access from nearby cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington.


## Venue overview

> An overview of the proposed venue(s): what are the capacities of each room, how will it accommodate the planned events?

For the first day of workshops, we propose to use the New York University [Kimmel Center](https://www.nyu.edu/life/campus-resources/kimmel-center/reservable-spaces.html). This has 3 larger rooms of capacity 250 to 300 attendees plus 11 smaller rooms of capacity 50 to 80 attendees. The large number of rooms allows for many parallel workshops (and payment is available on a room by room basis, allowing easier scaling).

For the three days of talks, we propose to use the [Metropolitan Pavilion](https://www.metropolitanevents.com/location/metropolitan-pavilion) and the adjacent [Altman Building](https://www.altmanbldg.com/venue). There is an internal doorway between the buildings. These buildings are about 15 minutes walk from the NYU building.

The Metropolitan Pavilion has one large room, accommodating up to 1500 attendees, and 3 smaller rooms, each accommodating 300 attendees. The Altman Building has a large room accommodating 550 attendees, and a smaller room accomodating 175 attendees.

While the proposal is based upon 1000 attendees, the large local population means that this conference size could easily be exceeded; 1500 attendees does not seem difficult to achieve. 

We propose to use the three smaller rooms in the Metropolitan Pavilion plus the whole of the Altman Building will be used for parallel talks and booths for sponsors. The Metropolitan Pavilion main floor will be used for keynotes, breaks and social events.

## Suggested dates

> Potential dates (when venue is free/avoiding major meetings)

The preferred date is tutorials on 2020-07-07 (Tuesday), with the conference lasting from 2020-07-08 to 2020-07-10 (Wednesday to Friday).

The previous week is undesirable since it clashes with [The International Society for Bayesian Analysis World Meeting](https://bayesian.org/events/world-meetings), and many people may wish to attend both events.

## Accommodation

> Potential accommodation

There are around 40 hotels within a 20 minute walk of the proposed venues. New York has a strong public transit system, making the accommodation within a reasonable travelling distance effectively unlimited.

## Schedule and format

> Plans for the general format of the conference and the social program

We propose to follow the standard useR format.

- Tuesday consists of half day tutorials (at extra cost), and has a tourism-based social event in the evening.
- Talks run from Wednesday to Friday, including parallel sessions and at least six keynote talks.
- Wednesday includes a session for sponsors. The evening event is a drinks, networking, and poster session.
- Thursday includes breakout sessions for special interest groups. The evening event is a dinner (ticket required).
- Friday includes lightning talks and an early finish.


## Diversity, inclusion, accessibility

> Diversity and inclusion considerations: is the venue accessible, will there be on-site child care?

Yes and yes.

### Total costs

**$873.4k**

### Net cost after sponsorship

We propose to raise at least $200k in sponsorship, resulting in a net conference cost of **$673.4k**.

### Proposed pricing

Based upon 1000 attendees, the mean revenue per attendee needs to be $673. The budget is based upon a capacity of 1500 attendees, so having a break-even point at 1000 attendees does not seem unreasonable.

We propose the following pricing to achieve this.

- Industry: $1600
- Academic: $1200
- Student: $600

Early bird

- Industry: $1200
- Academic: $800
- Student: $400

For attendees not joining in with the workshops, 3 days would be 3/4 of the price. Some tickets will be provided free or at a discount for sponsors and people requiring financial assistance.
